# ex2D 2.0 Free Beta

We are coming back with the powerful, elegant and revolutionary ex2D 2.0! Since we are using a brand new framework, we want to
 release the free Beta to everyone so that we can have a project-proved, robust official release.

Check out the [release note][1] of ex2D 2.0 Beta to learn what's new! (Pretty much everything xD)

You can download the package here:

## Important Notice on Compatibility

ex2D 2.0 is __NOT Compatible__ with projects created with ex2D 1.X! Do not import ex2D 2.0 package into your ex2D 1.X project!
 It will break everything if you insist doing that. 

It's unfortunate that you can't upgrade your project to ex2D 2.0 and make it 100x better. But we can't make it even 2x better if
 we didn't drop the old framework. We also strongly recommend you to backup your project before import ex2D 2.0 package. We have
 this beta to find any big issue so let's be on the safe side by always have a back up to go to.

Once we are more sure about the work flow and assets pipeline, we may be able to write migration tool so you can have your 
 ex2D v1.X project upgraded.

## License

License wise, you are only allowed to use this beta for testing and personal researching purposes. The Beta package does not
 include commercial license that allow you to publish work created with ex2D 2.0.
