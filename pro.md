# How To Get Access To ex2D Development Github Repo

Our development team use [Github][1] to host ex2D source code.

[1]: http://github.com

Once you finished your ex2D Pro purchase, our custom support will contact you with your registered email address during purchase.

We will ask you to provide:

- Github account names that you want to have pull access to ex2D Development Github Repo. You can provide 5 account names at most per Pro license.
- ex2D Pro order number if you are not using the email registered during your purchase. If we can't find your email record, we will need the order number
so we can verify your license.

Once we have your Github account name, we will grant you access to the Github repo and send you an confirmation email as soon as possible. 

You can fork the Repo and pull the latest code changes any time you want. Since we are using the same Repo for development, you can always
 get the latest update to ex2D. If you feel like contribute your changes you can also send "pull request" so that your code can be used by all ex2D users.
