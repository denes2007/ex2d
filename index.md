## ex2D 2.0 Features

- __More Flexible Static Batching__: ex2D's own Static Batching allows you to define static sprites and render
them at lightning speed during runtime. 
- __Customizable Dynamic Batching__: ex2D's own Dynamic Batching allows you define the size of each mesh batch,
 so you can use different batching strategy according to the bottle neck of your project's performance. 
- __2D Scene Editor__: Create and edit your scene in the real 2D fashion! Everything here is 2D and what you see
 is what you get, plus a whole bunch of tools for sprites manipulating.
- __Revolutionary Layer system__: Managing batching, render order and hierarchy structure has never been easier.
- __Improved Atlas Editor__: Now supports sprite rotates, texture compression option and import atlas from tools
 like TexturePacker.
- __Team Collaboration Ready__: ex2D 2.0 changed the way how asset management work. Say goodbye to the pesky DB
 files we used in ex2D 1.X. Now textures are managed through TextureInfo, an asset type that you can easily put
 under version control.
